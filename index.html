                <h2>Seoul, Korea</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born in Seoul in 1960s. So I am a pretty old man. <br>
                    I spent my first 33 years there.<br> 
                    I met one woman a snowy day and have been married to her. Now she is named as an "angel". <br>
                    The reason why she got that name? Because she became a Saint due to the fact that she has been with me. Now the question is "Who is a sinner?"<br>
                    <br>
                    Hint: Follow the logic. The variables could not be undefined or nulled!

                <h2>Toledo, Ohio</h2>
                <p>
                    I never heard of Toledo before I had moved to there.<br>
                    The city was a bit old, but my three children said they had enjoyed their school lives there.<br>
                    You know what?<br>
                    I did not know how cute my children were at that time....<br>
                    It was because I was so busy and over-burdened...No time to be "true" Father...<br>
                    <br>
                    let input = "Stop making excuses. Live correctly"; <br>
                    console.log(input); //...Am I right? <br>
                    Answer: Yes, but some letters need to be stressed... go get TAs.

                <h2>Chicago, Illinois</h2>
                <p>
                    I did not lived there for a long time, but the impacts that city gave me were so strong.<br>
                    The huge city...like Seoul<br>
                    Still remembering its winter, lots of snow, and fiercing winds. It was so cold....but the feeling of got freshed!

                <h2>Saint Louis, Missouri</h2>
                <p>
                    Before coming to Saint Louis, the one thing I heard of was the summer weather is hot. But not that hot so far. <br>
                    And guess what? <br>
                    I am knowing that I still have energy to challenge myself to do something...totally different thing...<br>
                    <br>
                    Tomorrow I will cover how to code...Good night, everyone!!!
