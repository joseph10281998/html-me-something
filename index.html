                <h2>Seoul, Korea</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born in Seoul in 1960s. I am a pretty old man. <br>
                    I spent my first 33 years there.<br> 
                    I married the woman who has been called as an "angel". <br>
                    The reason why she has been called in that way is that she has been so patient with me all the time.

                <h2>Toledo, Ohio</h2>
                <p>
                    I never heard of Toledo before I had moved there.<br>
                    The city was a bit old, but my three children enjoyed their lives there.<br>
                    You know what? I did not know how cute my children were at that time....<br>
                    It was because I was so busy due to my study and work.

                <h2>Chicago, Illinois</h2>
                <p>
                    I did not lived there much time, but the impact that city gave me was so strong.<br>
                    I like Chicago, still remembering its winter, snow, and winds. It was so cold....

                <h2>Saint Louis, Missouri</h2>
                <p>
                    Before coming to Saint Louis, the only thing I know was the weather is hot. But not that hot so far. <br>
                    And guess what? <br>
                    I has come to realize that now I am still full of energy enough to bear all the things especially when I challenge to do something...
